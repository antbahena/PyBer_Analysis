# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of Project
In this assignment we looked to merge data and create charts that show the fares for different area types such as rural, suburban, and urban over several months. 

##Purpose
The ride share data is built to show how much money each area makes.

## Analysis and Challenges
The challenges presented in this module was the merging of different files in order to plot them correctly. You have to make sure you are merging correct fields into new data frames and plotting the X and Y axis correctly. This also involves a decent amount of formatting.

## Results
The final results show that the Urban areas are the bigger money makers so there should be a focus in those areas to gain more fares.
It is also clear that the Rural areas should be avoided as they bring in significantly less fares then the others.
Suburban areas are in the middle so there is no negative in continuing to support that area but it is clear the rural areas bring in the most money.
